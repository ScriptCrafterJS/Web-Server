# Web-Server
Series of Node.js HTTP servers. From returning a basic textual response to various data types from my servers: JSON, CSV, and HTML. Also, file loading with HTTP responses, combined to return an HTML page from the server to the user, and an API that uses information about the userâ€™s request can be created to determine what data should be sent in its response.

## Usage
- pick one of the .js files inside the first-servers folder
- run one of the files .js using node json.js, for example
```bash
node json.js
```
- test the server with another terminal
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```
- for route.js => curl http://localhost:8000/books or http://localhost:8000/authors
you could test the servers on the terminal and search engine
