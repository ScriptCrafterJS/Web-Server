# Web-Server
Series of Node.js HTTP servers. First, it returned a basic textual response. Then returns various types of data from our server: JSON, CSV, and HTML. Also combine file loading with HTTP responses to return an HTML page from the server to the user, and create an API that uses information about the userâ€™s request to determine what data should be sent in its response.

## Usage

- run one of the files .js using node json.js for example
- test the server by another terminal => curl http://localhost:8000
- for route.js => curl http://localhost:8000/books or http://localhost:8000/authors
you could test the servers on the terminal and search engine
